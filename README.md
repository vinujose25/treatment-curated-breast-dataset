## A pooled treatment-curated breast cancer gene expression dataset

### Abstract

Pre-clinical studies reported the immunogenic or immunomodulatory effects of traditional cancer therapies. However, the publicly available well-curated and harmonized breast cancer datasets, such as TCGA, METABRIC, and MetaGxBreast, lack careful curation of treatment regimens. Hence, limited exploration of the impact of therapies on the prognostic/predictive value of breast cancer biomarkers. Herein, we describe a pooled and treatment-curated gene-expression dataset to investigate the impact of treatments on the prognostic/predictive value of biomarkers. We searched the gene expression omnibus database repository to identify potential human breast cancer gene-expression datasets with treatment details. Published datasets with detailed treatment regimens, clinical endpoints, clinical-pathological, and gene-expression data were extracted and harmonized. The dataset described herein would help researchers explore the interaction between gene-expression biomarkers and immunogenic/immunomodulatory treatments in breast cancer.
